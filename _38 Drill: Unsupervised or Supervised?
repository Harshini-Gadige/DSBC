For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease: Supervised technique - regression.
Translate a set of images into variables for modeling: Both supervised and unsupervised technique - clustering and classification.
An ecommerce company wants to identify power users: Both supervised and unsupervised technique - clustering and classification.
That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users: Unsupervised technique - neural network.
You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model: Unsupervised technique - principal components analysis.
