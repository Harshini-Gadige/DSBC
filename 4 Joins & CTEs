1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
WITH rainy_days AS
(SELECT 
    w.date,
    w.events,
    w.zip
FROM
    weather w
WHERE
    w.events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY
	w.date)
	
SELECT
    t.trip_id,
	DATE(t.start_date) trip_date,
	t.start_station origin,
	t.end_station destination,
	t.duration duration
FROM
    trips t
JOIN 
    rainy_days r
ON 
    r.date=trip_date
ORDER BY
    t.duration DESC
LIMIT 3
          


2. Which station is empty most often?
WITH empty AS
(SELECT 
	station_id,
	name
FROM
	stations
GROUP BY
	station_id)

SELECT
	empty.station_id,
	empty.name,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available = 0 THEN 1 END) emptiness_frequency
FROM 
	status
JOIN 
	empty
ON 
	status.station_id = empty.station_id
GROUP BY 
	empty.station_id
ORDER BY
empty_count DESC 
LIMIT 1



3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
WITH volume AS
(SELECT 
	station_id,
	name,
 dockcount
FROM
	stations
GROUP BY
	station_id)
	
SELECT
	v.station_id,
	v.name,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN v.name = t.start_station THEN 1 END) origin_volume,	v.dockcount
FROM 
	volume v
JOIN 
	trips t
ON 
	v.name = t.start_station
GROUP BY 
	t.start_station
ORDER BY
	v.dockcount DESC 



4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
WITH rainy AS
(SELECT 
	date,
	events
FROM
	weather
WHERE 
	events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY
	date)
	
SELECT
	r.date,
	r.events,
	t.start_station,
	t.end_station,
	t.duration
FROM 
	rainy r
JOIN 
	trips t
ON 
	r.date = DATE(t.start_date)
GROUP BY 
	r.date
ORDER BY
	r.date ASC,
	MAX(t.duration)
