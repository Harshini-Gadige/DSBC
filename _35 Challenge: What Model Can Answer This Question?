You now have a fairly substantial starting toolbox of supervised learning methods that you can use to tackle a host of exciting problems. To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below. For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning and discuss your answers with your mentor.

Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.
Multivariate Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor.

You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Components Analysis, Partial Least Squares Regressor, or Lasso Regresspr.

Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.
Gradient-Boosted Random Forest Classifier. Calculating feature importances and interpreting them relative to any feature scaling done.

Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient.
Naive Bayes Classifier that uses text keyword features to determine e-mail importance, with a tolerance for more Type I error.

You have 1000+ features.
Principal Components Analysis, Partial Least Squares Regressor, or Lasso Regressor to reduce dimensionality.

Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.
Random Forest Classifier.

Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500.
Lasso, Multivariate Linear, or Ridge Regression given performance (learning speed) considerations. 

Identify faces in an image.
Support Vector Classifier that uses Kerneling to create a non-linear decision boundary.

Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.
K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier with Distance-Weighting.
