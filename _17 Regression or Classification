What color car someone is going to buy: Classification - Discrete Outcome {'Red','Blue','Black','White','n'}.
How many children a family will have: Classification - Discrete Outcome {1,2,3,4,5,6,n}.
If someone will sign up for a service: Classification - Discrete Outcome {'Signed Up','Didn't Sign Up'}.
The number of times someone will get sick in a year: Regression - Continuous Outcome.
The probability someone will get sick in the next month. Classification - Discrete Outcome {'Sick','Not Sick'}.
Which medicine will work best for a given patient: Classification - Discrete Outcome {x% Medication 1, x% Medication 2, x% Medication n}.
